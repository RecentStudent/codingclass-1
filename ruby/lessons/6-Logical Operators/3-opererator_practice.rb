# Operator Practice

# Create a method called "get_name" that prompts the
# user for their name and returns it.


# Create a method called "greet" with one argument
# that prints the user's name. If the name is the
# same as yours, print another message to the screen.


# Create a method called "get_number" that prompts the
# user to give a number they want to check to 
# be divisible by 3


# Create a method "divisible_by_3?" that returns
# true if the number is divisible by 3 and false
# if it is not.


# Use these methods to get the users name, get a number and
# print to the screen if the number is divisible by 3.
