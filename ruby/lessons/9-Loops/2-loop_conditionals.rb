# Conditions on the break

# Write a loop that breaks if a number
# greater than 10 is entered



# Write a program that asks for a users name. It
# must be at least 2 characters long and have no
# numbers. If it contains any of those, then
# require them to enter their name again.





# Create a program that asks a user to guess
# a random number between 0 and 5. If correct,
# print "You guessed correctly!", if not, have
# them guess again. Allow them to type "e" to 
# exit out of the program.
