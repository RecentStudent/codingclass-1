# =========================
# Unit Loops
# =========================

# Define an until loop that asks the user
# if they want the loop to continue by
# entering y/n.



# Here is the print_hello method from the while loop.

def print_hello(number_of_times)
  i = 0
  while i < number_of_times
    puts "hello"
    i += 1
  end
end

# Use an until loop that asks the user 
# how many times they want to print hello
# and exits if they enter a number greater than 5.
