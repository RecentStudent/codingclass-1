# =========================
# While Loops
# =========================

# A while loop is similar to the loop statement 
# and it uses a conditional to perform the logic.
# However, the while loop continues to run as 
# long as the conditional that is set up front 
# continues to return true. 



# Define a method print_hello that takes in
# and argument for hte number of times to print
# hello to the screen.



# Use that method to create a loop that asks
# the user how many times they want to print hello
# and exits if they enter a number greater than 5.
