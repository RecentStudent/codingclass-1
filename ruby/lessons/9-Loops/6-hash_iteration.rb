# =========================
# Hash Iteration
# =========================

# We will use the following hash:

hash = { "item" => "apple", "quantity" => 1, "type" => "Gala" }

# For hashes, the each method requires 
# two arguments, the key and value.
# We separate arguments to blocks using a comma, 
# just like method arguments:


# We can do this inline too:



# We can also use .each_pair to represent .each on hashes



# If we want to just iterate over the keys, we can use:



# Likewise to iterate over the values, we can use:
