# Given this array:

array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# We can loop through the elements in the
# array by calling .each



# We can call "item" anything we want:



# Having the do..end is called a block. We can 
# write this shorthand as:



# It is conventional to write blocks using 
# the do...end syntax for multiple lines of code 
# in the block and the braces {} syntax for single 
# line code blocks.

# We can also manipulate items inside the block
# without changing the original array.
