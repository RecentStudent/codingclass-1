# Accessing Items

# Index: The numbered position of an item 
# in an array. Arrays all start with the 
# first item having an index of 0.

# Starting with the following array:

grocery_list = ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "ice cream", "pie", "potatoes"]

# Assign to the variable "item1" 
# the value "milk" from the array, 



# Assign to the variable "item2" 
# the value "milk" from the array, 



# There are some special methods to access specific
# elements in an array. 



# We can also use a negative index to reverse the direction.
# What would array[-1] return?



# To access an item using the index, we can
# also use the method .fetch(index):



# If we provide a second argument in .fetch(),
# and there is no corresponding item in the array, 
# the second argument will be used as default:



# To find out the total number of items in an array,
# we can use two methods: .length and .count



# Count allows us to pass in an argument to
# count the number of elements that match that argument.



# Lastly, we can ask the array if it contains an item.
# We use the include? method with the argument of the desired item:
