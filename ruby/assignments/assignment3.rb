# Due Friday February 27th

# Write a ruby program that performs the 
# following actions:

# First, it asks for a name and saves it 
# to the variable name. It then prints
# 'Hello name' to the screen.


# Then it asks how you want to modify your name
# by typing in 'uppercase' or 'reverse'.



# Use a case statement to perform the method the user
# requested (either uppercase or reverse). If the user 
# types 'both', it should perform both actions. If a 
# user types anything other than what is required, it
# should return, 'Okay, maybe later.'
