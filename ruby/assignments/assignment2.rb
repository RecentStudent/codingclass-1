# Due Thursday February 2/26

# Write a ruby program that performs the 
# following actions:

# First, it asks for a name.
# If that name matches your name, return:
# "You are an awesome Ruby programmer!" otherwise
# return "Hi {name}"





# Next, it asks if you want to see your name backwards.
# This should take in yes or no. If yes, show them
# their name backwards. Otherwise say "Ok, maybe later."
